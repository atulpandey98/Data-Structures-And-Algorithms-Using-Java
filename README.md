# Data-Structures-And-Algorithms-Using-Java

![DSA](images.png)

This repository contains data structures and algorithms concepts and questions useful for interviews in Java.

## :dart: Objective

I will be uploading data structures and algorithms questions in Java in this repo. Feel free to contribute and get in touch! :smiley:

## :file_folder: Structure of the repository

As of now, the repository contains 3 main directories: Data Structures and Algorithms.
Data Structures

Contains all data structure questions categorised into sub-directories like stack, queue, etc according to their type.


* [BinaryTree](/BinaryTree)</br>
* [Strings](/Strings)</br>
* [Stack](/Stack.java)</br>


## Algorithms

This directory contains various types of algorithm questions like Dynamic Programming, Sorting, Greedy, etc. The current structure of this directory is like -

    Dynamic Programming
    Graphs
    Greedy
    Math
    Misc
    Sorting


## :clipboard: Things need to be done 

As you can see, the repo is still in its infancy. Here are some key things in the to-do.

    Algorithms
    More questions in data structures, especially for graph, circular linked list, tries, heaps and hash.

## :hand: Contributing

Contributions are always welcomed. :smiley: Feel free to raise new issues, file new PRs and star and fork this repo! :wink:
